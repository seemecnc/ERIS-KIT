ERIS KIT Delta 3D Printer
=========================

ERIS PARTS ONLY KITS 

Manufactured in Sept & Oct 2023. 

MITCH3D inspired the kit version.  Many folks on social media have seen the great work Mitch has done with SeeMeCNC printers.  The kit is a community project.  As such, SeeMeCNC only warranties the parts included. 

The ERIS KIT does not include a control board.  The controller and any other electronic parts will need to be sourced seperately.
